# Time Series Forecasting – End-to-End Pipeline

This repository presents an end-to-end workflow for time series forecasting using both classical statistical models and deep learning approaches.

## Objectives
- Explore real-world time series data
- Compare traditional and neural forecasting methods
- Evaluate models using robust, time-aware metrics

## Models Implemented
- Naive baseline
- ARIMA / Prophet
- LSTM neural network

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using walk-forward validation with MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics.

## Key Findings
- Classical models perform well for short-term trends
- LSTM captures non-linear patterns but requires careful tuning
